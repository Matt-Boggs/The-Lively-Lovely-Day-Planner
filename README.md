# The-Lively-Lovely-Day-Planner

## Homework assignment for 10/4

## Info:
This assignment was an introduction to day.js, and more practice with jquery and localstorage. There was also quite a bit of DOM traversal involved, and after finishing up I felt much more confident in my ability to grab the elements I need, and update them from within my script

## Some Problems Faced:

Initially I was using moment.js, and upon switching to day.js, tried to keep my original logic which was referencing moment. Issues in trying to use both simultaneously hammered in the idea of simplifying my code.
